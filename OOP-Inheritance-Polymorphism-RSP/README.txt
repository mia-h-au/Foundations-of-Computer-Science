Implement of a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game (RPS game) in Java. This is a one round game.  
Two players compete and, independently, choose one of Rock, Paper or Scissors. They then simultaneously declare their choices. 
The winner of the game is determined by comparing the choices of the players. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.

This programming assignment is a simulation of the RPS game, where we have one human player (you) and one computer player. 
As we cannot simulatetruly simultaneous choice, this program will take your choice and, without giving information on that choice to the computer player, ask the computer playerfor their choice. 
The two choices will then be compared to determine who has won.
